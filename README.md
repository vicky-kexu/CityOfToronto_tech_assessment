# CityOfToronto_tech_assessment

This repository is used to display the results from CityOfToronto's technical assessment. All datasets are publically avaiable [here](https://open.toronto.ca/). The main jupyter rmd file that will display all the works is take_home_assignment.rmd. For interactive mapping, I used leaflet with the CartoDB Positron base map.
